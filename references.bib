    abstract = {This extensively revised and expanded third edition of the Artech Housebestseller, Computational Electrodynamics: The Finite-Difference
        Time-DomainMethod, offers you the most up-to-date and definitive resource on thiscritical method for solving Maxwell’s equations. There has been
        considerableadvancement in FDTD computational technology over the past few years, and thisnew edition brings you the very latest details with four
        new invited chapterson advanced techniques for PSTD, unconditional stability, provably stableFDTD-FETD hybrids, and hardware acceleration. Moreover,
        you find manycompletely new sections throughout the book, including major updates onconvolutional PML ABCs; dispersive, nonlinear, classical-gain,
        and quantum-gain materials; and micro-, nano-, and bio- photonics.This single resource provides complete guidance on FDTD techniques andapplications,
        from basic concepts, to the current state-of-the-art. It enablesyou to more efficiently and effectively design and analyze key electronics andphotonics
        technologies, including wireless communications devices, high-speeddigital and microwave circuits, and integrated optics. You find sample FDTDcodes
        written in Matlab® that serve as a self-guided refresher, and examplesof how to use the FDTD method on a wide range of projects in the field. What’smore,
        to supplement the third edition, the authors and publisher have createda Website where you can find solutions to the problems, sample FDTD PML codes,text
        updates/errata, and downloadable color graphics and videos. Consequently,this new edition is the ideal textbook for both a senior-year undergraduateelective
        course and a graduate course in computational electrodynamics.},
